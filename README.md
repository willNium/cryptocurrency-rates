### Using the HistoDay API
```source histoday```

Output from the script will be put into a data directory that will be created where the script is run
The files are named after the currency being converted

A timestamp can be easily from https://www.epochconverter.com/

Converting the timestamps back to dates is probably best done in excel, referencing: https://www.extendoffice.com/documents/excel/2473-excel-timestamp-to-date.html

Output from previous runs gets cleared upon starting a new run.  This shouldn't be a problem since the data is historical, just something to be aware of.
